<div class="intro">There are three ways to load caches into
GeoBeagle:</div>
<h3>BCaching.com</h3>
Once setup, it's by far the easiest: you get updates over the internet!
You must be a premium member of Geocaching.com to use this.
<ol>
	<li>Set up a free account on BCaching.com</li>
	<li>Tell Geocaching.com to email each Pocket Query to your
	BCaching.com address</li>
	<li>Click "Menu/Settings", and add your BCaching username/password</li>
</ol>
And then just click "Menu/Sync" to get updates.
<h3>Import GPX/LOC/ZIP files</h3>
You'll need to download the files to your desktop computer, then mount
your phone's sdcard to your computer.
<ol>
	<li>Copy gpx/loc/zip files to the download folder of your sdcard</li>
	<li>Click "Menu/Sync"</li>
</ol>
<h3>Search online</h3>
You can get cache data "on the fly", by clicking on a link on the
geocaching.com web page; only the coordinates are imported. Getting more
information by page scraping (as some other apps do) is a violation of
geocaching.com's Terms of Service.
<ol>
	<li>Click "Menu/Search Online"</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions on that page</li>
</ol>

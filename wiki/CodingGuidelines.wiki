#summary Coding guidelines for `GeoBeagle`=


  * Download android-formatting.xml and android.importorder files and import them into Eclipse.  Use them to format your code before checking in.
  * Make sure new files have unix line-endings, not DOS.
  * Make sure all the tests pass!
  * Even better, install `EclEmma`, and make sure you have 100% test coverage for your new code.
  * Untestable code goes into the "di" directory.  The following code does not need unit tests: one-time object constructors and graph construction.  One-time object configuration (e.g. setting up a MapView). Code derived from Android classes (but put most of the work into a delegate, so *that* can be tested.
  * A class named MyFancyClass should generally have variables named "myFancyClass"--that way Eclipse will automatically rename it if you change your mind about the name.

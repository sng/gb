*Beta ver does not work!  NOT even listed on web where updates are.  Instructions to not match what options are.  Very frustrating and disappointing!*

How does it not work?  Please be more specific as to problems.   (File a bug or contact us by email at geobeagleteam@gmail.com). Updates are on http://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/downloads/list.

*It says "server unavailable" nearly everywhere I go.*

Might be an internet connectivity problem.  Click Menu/Go to URL.  Try opening that page in a browser and see what happens.

*Position is twice as far as it shud be.*

There's a bug with locations near 0 latitude/longitude.  If that's the case, please download the latest version from this page and let us know if that helps.  If not, please give more specific instructions for how to reproduce the problem.

*Highly inaccurate.  Missing many caches.  Site data should be integrated directly into app.*

Please download the tricorder app and check to see if GeoBeagle is reporting different coordinates.  For the missing caches--please click Menu/Go to URL from the "nearest cache" web page and email us the resulting url.  We are working on pocket query support, which will provide tighter integration.

#summary Release Notes for GeoBeagle versions

= v0.31 =

This version involves a db upgrade that will wipe your data.

Many fixes:
  * fix crash when going to cache list page if all the location providers are off
  * removed many gratuitous writes to the database
  * changed db key to be the cache id
  * check for duplicate writes, and delete previous record (the combination of these bugs meant that we were writing many many copies of the same data, gradually bloating the database)
  * only save the edit field on pause

Remaining critical issues:
  * Crash bug when reorienting phone during update (see http://bend-ing.blogspot.com/2008/11/properly-handle-progress-dialog-in.html)
  * Back button loses changes to edit control.  Edit control will need to be rewritten as a separate activity to fix this.
  * No cache hints are imported from the gpx.

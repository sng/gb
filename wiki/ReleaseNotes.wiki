#summary Release Notes for GeoBeagle versions

= v0.68 = 
  * Georg Lukas' patches to support opencaching sites (thanks Georg!).
  * adds a show all vs show nearest caches menu.  
  * updating of cache distances on the fly (also, much faster sorting / filtering)
  * automatically sort on the fly (the sort button has been removed)
  * a bunch of fixes for force close issues related to the gps being disabled

= v0.60 =
Puts the gps status widget into the cache list page too.

= v0.50 =
Added support for intermediate waypoint files, and loc files.  Like GPX files, LOC is a "sync", not an "import" operation--deleting the LOC file will remove the cache from Geobeagle.

Added a "refresh" button to cache list page, which will update the distances and re-sort.  This is a stop-gap until we get a nicer UI in place here.

= v0.48 =
Move My Location down to menu, where it should be less confusing.  Fix non-US locale bug.

= v0.47 = 
Fixes bug where no caches were getting deleted if sync directory is empty.
Changed cache list title bar to be clearer.

= v0.45 =
Supports uploading from gpx files.  Sync directory changed to /sdcard/download, to match browser download dir.
